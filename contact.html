			I enjoy creating and sharing - I treasure the feeling that I get when I see others enjoy my work, learn from my work or being entertained by it.
			I decided to build this site in order to have a place where I can gather all my projects, document them properly and share them with you.
			I may also have the oprotunity to share some of the projects of a few close friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may ask "why not make a profile on instructables or any other such website?".
			The answer is that I wanted to try and take on the challenge of building a website on my own - using HTML and CSS.
			Making a profile and using it on a platform is one thing but I have come to realize that making your own site is quite another - there is so much freedom in what you can do.
			Thus, this site was born!

		<h3>
			My background
		</h3>
		<p>
			I studied classical and electric guitar in my younger years and have acquired the RGT grade 7 diploma for electric guitar.
			I graduated from the “Lycée Léonin de Patissia Athènes” high-school.
			Finally, I received a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Thessaly.
			Other than my “legitimately proven knowledge” that is stated in the previous three sentences, I have been developing other skills on my own as well.
			This world has so many beautiful and intriguing subjects in it that every month I catch myself trying to learn or create something new (learning HTML and CSS and creating this site for instance).
			<!-- Music, engineering, electronics, programming, control - these are the broad subjects that interest me most of the time-->
