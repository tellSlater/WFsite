			Pico planter
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<p>
			In this project, I turn a simple self hydrating pot into a "smart" pot, featuring:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Lots of sensors:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Temperature
					</li>
					<li>
						Humidity
					</li>
					<li>
						Light
					</li>
					<li>
						Soil moisture
					</li>
					<li>
						Water tank level
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Water pump
			</li>
			<li>
				Water tank level alarm
			</li>
			<li>
				Local data logging
			</li>
			<li>
				Cloud data logging
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The reason quotes were used for "smart" is that this was mostly a way to learn new things for me.
			All of these sensors and logging is not necessary to automate watering plants.
			The pump alone operating on a timer is sufficient.
			<b>This page is a work in progress</b>.

		<h3>
			Design
		</h3>
		<p>
			The wooden part that is placed on top of the LACK table, was made by joining together two 30x60 cm pieces
			of wood. The material used was a 18mm thick long oak bord with width 30cm. The two 60cm long pieces were cut
			from that piece of wood and joined together with wood glue to for a 60x60 cm table top.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/power_bank/schematic.jpg" alt="schematic.jpg" title="Power bank schematic">
		<p>
			The wood was finished by sanding up to 180 grit and applying several coats of linseed oil.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Printed fixtures
		</h3>
		<p>
			A kotatsu top is supposed to fit one top of the table so that a blanket can be placed in between.
			For that reason plastic fixtures were designed in fusion 360 that are meant to help the wooden top
			fit nicely on top of the table and keep it in place on top of a blanket.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/kotatsu_lack/fusion_fixture.png" alt="fusion_fixture.png" title="Designed plastic fixture">
		<p>
			The plastic fixtures were 3d printed and screwed under the wooden top part.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Finished kotatsu
		</h3>
		<p>
			The finished result is a wooden board roughly larger than the top surface of an IKEA LACK table
			that fits almost snuggly on top of it with the plastic fixtures. Some space is required between the
			fixtures and the kotatsu to allow for a blanket to fit between them.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/kotatsu_lack/fusion_3D_top_off.png" alt="fusion_3D_top_off.png" title="Finished kotatsu">
		<p>
			The only thing that remains is placing a blanket between the table and the wooden top, and fitting the top snuggly above the blanket.

		<h3>
			Downloads
		</h3>
		<p>
			The plastic fixture can be downloaded <a href="/projects/normal/kotatsu_lack/kotatsu_fxture.stl" download>here</a>
			and it can be printed on its side with no supports.
