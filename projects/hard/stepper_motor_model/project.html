			Stepper motor math model
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<p>
			A stepper motor is a special kind of brushless DC motor.
			It can execute precise movements without the need of a closed loop control system or a sensor.
			<b>In this page  a mathematical model of such a motor is derived and the model's parameters are examined and tuned
			so that the model's performance mimics the actual performance of the motor.</b>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Motor used
		</h3>
		<p>
			This model focuses on a NEMA 17 stepper motor but the process followed is similar for modelling other stepper motors as well.
			The exact motor used is described by the code name 42HD4027-01 under the NEMA standard.
			The last section in this page - <a href="#mdesign">Motor design</a> - includes mechanical drawings, photos and the datasheet of this stepper motor.

		</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Inputs</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This stepper motor has two separate phases.
			Therefore, the main inputs for the model are <b>the two voltage differentials applied to each of the two phases</b>.
			Other secondary inputs are the <b>moment of inertia of the load attached to the motor</b> and
			any <b>external torques applied to the load and/or motor shaft</b>.
			Also some inputs in the form of primary conditions are the <b>initial angular position and speed of the rotor</b> and <b>the initial currents in each phase</b>.
			The <b>moment of inertia of the load</b> can also be considered as an input.
		</p>
		<p class="secondary">
			The friction in the motor is neglected in this model but it can easily be implemented as an external source of torque.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Outputs</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			After solving the differential equations of the model, <b>the kinematic response of the rotor</b> can be extracted as well as <b>the electric response of the phases</b>.
			On the kinematic side, the outputs are the angular position, speed, acceleration, jerk(or rate of change of acceleration) and torque.
			The electric response includes phase current and voltage induced by the spinning magnetic rotor.

		<h3>
			Physics
		</h3>
		<p>
			These are the basic physics laws used to describe the behavior of the motor:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Newton's second law for rotation</b><br>
				The torque applied is directly proportional to the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration.<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					T = I \cdot \dot \omega
					\label{eq:newt2}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>kirchhoff's second law</b><br>
				The directed sum of the voltages around any closed loop is zero.<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					V_1 + V_2 + V_3 - V = 0
					\label{eq:kirch2}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
				<img src="" alt="closedLoopVoltages.jpg">
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Faraday's law of induction</b><br>
				The EMF induced in a conductor is given by the rate of change of the magnetic flux in it.<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					\varepsilon = - \frac{d \Phi_B}{dt}
					\label{eq:fara}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Apart from the above well known and broadly applicable theorems,
			there are a few equations that specifically describe the nature and behavior of some aspects of this stepper motor:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Phase current/max torque linear dependency</b><br>
				A phase's current is linearly dependent to the maximum torque the phase can exert to the rotor.
				Therefore, the two can be related to each other by the use of one constant (\( K_T \)).<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					T_{maxPhase} = K_T \cdot I_{Phase}
					\label{eq:curtor}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Phase torque</b><br>
				The torque a phase exerts on the rotor depends on the phase current as well as on the rotor's position.
				This happens because of the way the motor is built - due to geometric characteristics of the rotor and the stator.<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					T_{Phase} = - K_T \cdot I_{Phase} \cdot \sin (p \cdot \theta)
					\label{eq:phator}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
				\( \theta \) is the rotor's angular position and <br>
				\( p \) the number of teeth on the rotor (on one side only).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Detent torque</b><br>
				This is a "parasitic" torque that exists due to the magnetic rotor.
				It is small in magnitude compared to the motor's maximum holding torque but should still be accounted in the model
				since it interferes significantly with the positioning and movements of the rotor.<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					T_{dT} = - T_{dTmax} \cdot \sin (4 \cdot p \cdot \theta)
					\label{eq:detto}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Rate of change of magnetic flux linkage between one phase and the rotor</b><br>
				This rate is important because, according to Faraday's law, it corresponds to the induced EMF in the phase.<br>
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					\frac{d \Psi_A}{dt} = p \cdot \Psi_M \cdot \sin (p \cdot \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dt}
					\label{eq:phidt}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
				\( \Psi_M \) is the maximum magnetic flux linkage between a phase and the rotor.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Shaping the equations
		</h3>
		<p>
			In order to derive the model of this system,
			every equation that describes its nature must be related to each other.
			Initially, the total torque felt by the rotor can be expressed as:
		</p>
		<p class="mjax">
			\begin{equation}
			T_{sum} = T_A + T_B + T_{dT} + T_{ext}
			\label{eq:Tsum}
			\end{equation}
		</p>
		<p>
			\( T_{sum} \) is the total torque on the rotor,<br>
			\( T_A \) is the torque exerted by phase A on the rotor,<br>
			\( T_B \) is the torque exerted by phase B on the rotor and<br>
			\( T_{ext} \) is the sum of external torques on the rotor.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="torqueSum.jpg">
		<p>
			After substituting the known equations for \( T_{sum} \), \( T_A \), \( T_B \) and \( T_{dT} \), we get:
		</p>
		<p class="mjax">
			\begin{equation}
			(I_{ROTOR} + I_{LOAD} ) \cdot \dot \omega =
			- K_T \cdot I_{A} \cdot \sin (p \cdot \theta)
			- K_T \cdot I_{B} \cdot \cos (p \cdot \theta)
			- T_{dTmax} \cdot \sin (4 \cdot p \cdot \theta)
			+ T_{ext}
			\label{eq:Tsum2}
			\end{equation}
		</p>
		<p>
			The two expressions for the torques \( T_A \) and \( T_B \) have a phase difference of \( \pi / 2 \).
			This behavior is due to the way the motor is constructed -
			it is due to the geometric characteristics of the stator and rotor and the way they interact.
		</p>
		<p>
			Afterwards, kirchhoff's 2nd law can be applied for each of the two phases of the motor:
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase A
		</p>
		<p class="mjax">
			\begin{equation}
			V_A = R \cdot I_A + L \dot{I_A} - e_A
			\label{eq:VsumA}
			\end{equation}
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase B
		</p>
		<p class="mjax">
			\begin{equation}
			V_B = R \cdot I_B + L \dot{I_B} - e_B
			\label{eq:VsumB}
			\end{equation}
		</p>
		<p>
			\( I_A \) and \( I_B \) are the currents in phases A and B respectively,<br>
			\( V_A \) and \( V_B \) are the applied voltages,<br>
			\( R \) and \( L \) are the phase resistance and phase inductance and<br>
			\( e_A \) and \( e_B \) are the voltages induced in each phase by the spinning rotor.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="phaseVoltageDiagram.jpg">
		<p>
			According to Faraday's law ( \ref{eq:fara} ) the induced voltage is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage.
			Therefore, substituting \( e_A \) and \( e_B \) for the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage between one phase and the rotor we get:
		</p><p>
			Phase A
		</p>
		<p class="mjax">
			\begin{equation}
			V_A = R \cdot I_A + L \dot{I_A} - p \cdot \Psi_M \cdot \sin (p \cdot \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dt}
			\label{eq:VsumA2}
			\end{equation}
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase B
		</p>
		<p class="mjax">
			\begin{equation}
			V_B = R \cdot I_B + L \dot{I_B} - p \cdot \Psi_M \cdot \cos (p \cdot \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dt}
			\label{eq:VsumB2}
			\end{equation}
		</p>
		<p>
			The two expressions for the induced voltages \( e_A \) and \( e_B \) have a phase difference of \( \pi / 2 \).
			This again happens due to the geometric characteristics of the stator and rotor and the way they interact.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, equations \ref{eq:Tsum2}, \ref{eq:VsumA2}, \ref{eq:VsumB2} and
			the initial conditions for speed and position of the rotor and
			initial currents in phases A and B
			are enough to solve this system and calculate the response of the motor.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Equation parameters
		</h3>
		<p>
			The parameters in equation \ref{eq:Tsum2} are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				\( I_{ROTOR} \) - moment of inertia of the rotor
			</li>
			<li>
				\( I_{LOAD} \) - moment of inertia of the load (although this could also be considered an input)
			</li>
			<li>
				\( K_T \) - constant relating phase current to maximum phase torque
			</li>
			<li>
				\( p \) - number of teeth on the rotor
			</li>
			<li>
				\( T_{dTmax} \) - maximum detent torque
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The parameters in equations \ref{eq:VsumA2} and \ref{eq:VsumB2} are:
		</p>
		<ol start="6">
			<li>
				\( R \) - phase resistance
			</li>
			<li>
				\( L \) - phase inductance
			</li>
			<li>
				\( \Psi_M \) - maximum magnetic flux linkage between a phase and the rotor
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Changing the values of these parameters will affect the behavior of the model.
			In order to tune these parameters so that the model mimics the behavior of the motor,
			their values must be derived from the motor's characteristics.
			This is possible by either making measurements on the motor or by consulting the motor's datasheet.
			Unfortunately, not all information needed is always available in the datasheet,
			so some measurements are often required.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Tuning the parameters
		</h3>
		<p>
			The parameters can be tuned by either consulting the motor's datasheet or taking measurements of the motor.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>\( I_{ROTOR} \) - moment of inertia of the rotor</b><br>
				It is usually given in the motor's datasheet but can also be calculated by the rotor's geometry.
				<img src="" alt="IrotorDatasheet.jpg">
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( I_{LOAD} \) - moment of inertia of the load</b><br>
				Can be arbitrarily chosen or should be calculated for a specific load based on the load characteristics.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( K_T \) - constant relating phase current to maximum phase torque</b><br>
				Revisiting equation \ref{eq:curtor}, it is evident that a phase current value and
				its corresponding maximum phase torque are enough to calculate \( K_T \).
				Unfortunately, the motor's datasheet provides the maximum phase current and the
				corresponding maximum holding torque of the <u>combination of two phases</u>.
				To derive the holding torque of one phase, the two phase holding torque must be divided by \( \sqrt{2} \).
				Therefore, \( K_T \) can be calculated by:
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					K_T = \frac{T_{hmaxPhase}}{I_{maxPhase}} = \frac{T_{hmax2Phase}}{ \sqrt{2} \cdot I_{maxPhase}}
					\label{eq:KTcalc}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
				Where:<br>
				\( I_{maxPhase} \) is the nominal current of a phase,<br>
				\( T_{hmaxPhase} \) is the maximum holding toque of one phase and<br>
				\( T_{hmax2Phase} \) is the maximum holding torque of two phases.
				<img src="" alt="KTDatasheet.jpg">
				Manufacturers probably prefer to display the two phase holding torque in the datasheet because it is greater.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( p \) - number of teeth on the rotor</b><br>
				The rotor has as many teeth as a quarter of the steps the motor can execute in a full circle (360°).
				<img src="" alt="stepAngleDatasheet.jpg">
				Consequently, for a step angle of 1.8°:
				<p class="mjax">
					\begin{equation}
					p = \frac{360°}{ 1.8° \cdot 4 } = 50
					\label{eq:pcalc}
					\end{equation}
				</p>
				Alternatively, the teeth of the rotor can be counted by eye.
				<img src="" alt="rotorTeethCount.jpg">
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( T_{dTmax} \) - maximum detent torque</b><br>
				This value is rarely if ever given in the datasheet.
				The maximum torque the motor exerts when both phases are inactive (0 current) is the maximum detent torque.
				It can be measured with a precision scale by placing the motor on a jig as shown in the next image:
				<img src="" alt="dTJig.jpg">
				Alternatively, it can be estimated to be about 2% of the motor's two phase holding torque
				(this percentage gets smaller for bigger motors).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( R \) - phase resistance</b><br>
				The motor's phase resistance is given in the datasheet and can be easily measured using a multimeter.
				<img src="" alt="resistanceDatasheet.jpg">
				<img src="" alt="resistanceMulti.jpg">
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( L \) - phase inductance</b><br>
				The motor's phase inductance is also given in the datasheet and can be easily measured using an LCR meter.
				<img src="" alt="inductanceDatasheet.jpg">
				<img src="" alt="inductanceLCR.jpg">
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>\( \Psi_M \) - maximum magnetic flux linkage between a phase and the rotor</b><br>
				This value will most probably not be in the datasheet and cannot be estimated based on other information in it.
				There are several ways to calculate it but they require some tools.
				The main concept is measuring the signal produced in a phase when the rotor is rotated and then
				deriving the maximum flux linkage based on that signal.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Oscilloscope methods</b><br>
						The probes of the oscilloscope are tied to a phase of the motor.
						The motor's shaft is rotated at a constant speed with a help of an external motor (e.g. a hand drill).
						The induced voltage is measured - it has the shape of a sine wave.
						<img src="" alt="inducedWave.jpg">
						This induced sine wave is described by equation \ref{eq:phidt} and when it takes its maximum value the equation gives:
						\begin{equation}
						\frac{d \Psi_A}{dt}_{max} = e_{Amax} = p \cdot \Psi_M \cdot \frac{d \theta}{dt} \Rightarrow
						\Psi_M = \frac{e_{Amax}}{p \cdot \omega}
						\label{eq:phidtmax}
						\end{equation}
						The maximum flux linkage between the rotor and a phase can be calculated by
						the angular speed of the rotor(\( \omega \)) and the corresponding maximum induced voltage in a phase(\( e_{Amax} \)).
						The maximum induced voltage can be directly extracted from the graph of the induced voltage.
						The speed of the rotor is directly related to and can be estimated by the period of the signal(\( T_e \)):
						\begin{equation}
						\omega = \frac{ 0.1257 }{T_e}
						\label{eq:Tspeed}
						\end{equation}
						There is also a way to directly calculate the maximum magnetic flux linkage using the induced signal.
						It is actually equal to the area under each of the sine wave's curve and the time axis.
						Some modern oscilloscopes might even be able to integrate the curve and get a quick result.
						In the next image each of the areas(E) are equal to the maximum magnetic flux linkage.
						<img src="" alt="inducedWaveE.jpg">
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Multimeter and tachometer</b><br>
						An estimation of the magnetic flux linkage can be made using these simpler tools.
						In this case the multimeter is used to measure the RMS value of the induced sine wave and
						the tachometer is used to measure the speed of the rotation.
						<img src="" alt="MultiTacho.jpg">
						Afterwards, the maximum induced voltage can be calculated by multiplying the RMS value by \( \sqrt{2} \)
						and then equation \ref{eq:phidtmax} can be used to calculate the maximum magnetic flux linkage.
