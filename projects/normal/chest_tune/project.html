            <h2>Chest tune</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The idea behind this project was to create a "Zelda chest" - a chest that plays a tune when opened,
                much like it happens in the game! Here I <b>explore/transcribe the melodies</b> used in game and
                try my best to <b>reproduce them using as minimal hardware as possible</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>Melody</h3>
            <p>
                The easiest melody to select in order to reproduce with cheap hardware would be one of the oldest
                zelda games that were using 8-bit sound. For reference I selected one of my all time favorite
                games, <b>Link's Awakening</b>. This is the sound that chests make when they are opened in game:
            </p>

            </audio>
            <p>
                I was able to interpret this as three melodies played together using square waves at 25% duty cycle
                which sounds like this:
            </p>

            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>
                First, I experimented with a pi-pico w and piezo electric speakers,
                since it was the closest I had on my desk. I needed to find out if the piezo sound was
                appealing enough, so I created the waveforms and used resistors to add them and feed them directly
                to the piezo speaker. The result was acceptable! So the <b>piezo speaker</b> was selected for the project.
            </p>
            <img
                src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/piezo_speaker.jpeg"
                alt="piezo_speaker.jpeg"
                title="Piezo speaker"
            />
            <p>
                Selecting the right hardware was not super easy yet, since I was not perfectly sure about how much space would
                be needed to write code that could handle 25% duty cycle square waves - they are a bit more demanding that 50% duty cycle
                square waves. I started with the least powerful chip I had in stock, an
                <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATtiny13A-Data-Sheet-DS40002307A.pdf">ATtiny13A</a>,
                and was able to develop the code to fit the device - so then I selected the <b>ATtiny13A</b> fot the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the power source I went with an <b>CR2032 button cell</b>. Since this is a very common type of cell,
                the same size cell holders were readily available and at a good price.
            </p>
            <img
                src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/2032holder.jpeg"
                alt="2032holder.jpeg"
                title="CR2032 battery holder"
            />
            <p>
                Since the provided voltage is ~3V, I decided to use an op-amp to help keep the volume high.
                Using an op-amp in a battery powered project means that you either need a low
                power op-amp that has a deactivation feature or use a normal op-amp with a transistor for deactivating it manually
                - this helps keep the power consumption low when the application is not in use.
                In my case I went with the second option since I had transistors lying around and the low power op-amps seemed to be much more expensive.
                I ordered a bunch of <b>MCP602 op-amps</b>. These packages contain two op-amps and are fairly cheap.
            </p>
            <img
                src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/MCP602.jpeg"
                alt="MCP602.jpeg"
                title="MCP602 dual op-amp"
            />
            <p>
                The N-MOSFET of my choice is the <a href="http://www.szhhe.com/file/H2302A.pdf">A2SHB</a> as in most of my projects.
                It is a small SOT23 package and can be fully turned on with a mere 2.5V on its gate.
                This makes it perfect for battery powered applications.
            </p>
            <img
                src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/a2shb.jpeg"
                alt="a2shb.jpeg"
                title="A2SHB N-MOSFET"
            />

            <p>
                All of the components were ordered in <b>SOP8</b> packages which are fairly small and at the same time
                easy to solder by hand.
            </p>
            <img
                src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/attiny13a.jpeg"
                alt="attiny13a.jpeg"
                title="ATtiny13A SOP8 package"
            />
            <p>
                Finally, for triggering the sound, the simplest sensor to use would be an <b>LDR(Light Dependant Resistor)</b>.
                This can be hooked up to the ATtiny13A using a voltage divider configuration and then wake up the chip
                using its pin change interrupt feature, as soon as light is detected.
                The logic behind this is that the gadget will be hidden inside any chest/container,
                and then, when the light pours into the chest once it is opened, the LDR will detect it and trigger the sound.
            </p>

            <h3>Schematic</h3>
            <p>
                The schematic and board were drawn in Fusion360.
                <ul>
                    <li>The battery powers both the op-amp and the ATtiny13A.</li>
                    <li>The op-amp is connected to ground via a MOSFET</li>
                    <li>One pin of the ATtiny is used to control the MOSFET</li>
                    <li>Three pins of the ATtiny are used to produce the three melodies.</li>
                    <li>One pin is used to read the LDR divider</li>
                </ul>
                <a class="img" href="/projects/normal/chest_tune/schematic_big.jpeg" target="_blank">
                    <img src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/schematic_small.jpeg" alt="SCHsmall.jpg" title="Schematic" />
                </a>
            </p>

            <h3>Board</h3>
            <p>
                The board was designed to be as small as possible while holding
                all the THT/bigger components on the bottom side to minimize board height and make soldering easier.
            </p>
            <a class="img" href="/projects/normal/chest_tune/board_big.jpeg" target="_blank">
                <img src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/board_small.jpeg" alt="SCHsmall.jpg" title="Board" />
            </a>

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>
                The code was developed in Microchip Studio using the AVR-GCC compiler.
                It is fairly simple and uses the ATtiny13A's internal oscillator at 9.6MHz.
                I have uploaded the project on GitHub, you can find it
                <a href="https://github.com/tellSlater/chest_tune/blob/main/main.cpp">here</a>!
                <ul>
                    <li>The chip enters shutdown mode, deactivating the op-amp's MOSFET as well, after the melody is played</li>
                    <li>A pin change interrupt wakes the chip when there is a change in light</li>
                    <li>The melody will only play when there is a change from darkness to light -
                        this is ensured by continuously checking the light conditions with a watchdog interrupt</li>
                    <li>Timer0 overflow interrupt is used to count samples at 37500Hz</li>
                    <li>The quarter_square function uses the samples to calculate the melody's square waves</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>
                The components were put together on a small breadboard along with the op-amp and the MOSFET.
                Everything worked as expected but the sound quality was quite bad:
            </p>
            <img
                src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/breadboard_prototype.jpg"
                alt="breadboard_prototype.jpg"
                title="Ptototype on breadboard"
            />
            <audio controls>
                <source src="/projects/normal/chest_tune/breadboard_chest_sound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>
            <p>
                I decided to research into more methods to improve the sound quality given that the
                only power source will be a coin cell.
