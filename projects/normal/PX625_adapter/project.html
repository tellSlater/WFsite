			PX625 vintage battery adapter
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is an adapter that uses modern battery cells and emulates the behavior of discontinued old batteries.
			Some vintage products require batteries that are no longer available in the market and this adapter is the solution.
			<b>In this page there is information about its design and use as well as files for creating one</b>.
		</p>

		<h3>
			The old batteries
		</h3>
		<p>
			This adapter replaces a series of button cells that were discontinued because their chemistry was harmful to the environment.
			Manufacturing of the PX625 and all mercury batteries is today banned in most countries.
			Nevertheless, at the time of writing this page (12/2021), mercury batteries are still available for purchase on e-Bay by Russian sellers.
		</p>
		<p>
			These batteries were chosen by manufacturers in the past because they offer very stable voltage throughout their entire discharge cycle.
			This enabled the manufacturers to avoid installing voltage regulators in their cameras and products thus cutting a lot of costs from production.
			Out of all the vintage cameras today, only a couple models are equipped with voltage regulators and can function correctly with modern batteries
			(more information <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/PX625" target="_blank">here</a>).

		<h3>
			Modern batteries
		</h3>
		<p>
			Today, there are two kinds of batteries that are mostly used to replace old mercury cells:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><b>Zinc-air batteries</b> are mostly intended for use with hearing aids.
					Much like old mercury cells, these cells are able to produce a stable output voltage.
					They have good capacity (2-4 months of use) but need ventilation in order to work.
					These batteries produce voltage through a chemical reaction that requires oxygen.
					Therefore, when using these cells the battery compartment must have access to fresh air.
					<b>In order to use a zinc-air battery</b>, it is important to have good ventilation in the battery compartment
					and, also, some short of adapter might be needed because they are typically smaller in size than the old mercury batteries.
				</p>
				<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/zinc-airEnergizer.jpg" alt="zinc-airEnergizer.jpg" title="Energizer zinc-air button cell">
				<p>
					These cells have tabs on them for blocking the oxygen and staying inactive.
					In order to use one, its tab must be removed.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>Silver oxide batteries</b> are mostly marketed for use with watches.
					They have a stable voltage output and lower capacity than the zinc-air batteries
					but they do not require air to work since all the reactants are enclosed within the cell.
					<b>Using silver oxide batteries</b> requires a way to regulate their higher voltage and
					it also requires some short of adapter due to their smaller size.
				</p>

		<h3>
			Schematic
		</h3>
		<p>
			Silver oxide battery give off a 1.55V potential.
			Most vintage cameras require around 1.35V to operate correctly.
			Therefore, 0.2V must be dropped across the diode.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/schematic.jpg" alt="schematic.jpg" title="Adapter schematic">
		<p>
			This diode must be carefully selected so that it drops as much voltage as needed.
			The selection becomes a bit complicated because the diode's forward voltage is a function of the current drawn through it.
			Ideally, the current draw of each application should be measured before selecting the diode.
			The diode for this adaptor was chosen by assuming most old light meters draw between 1mA and 1uA of current.
			After going through datasheets of various diodes, the BAT47 schottky diode was chosen.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/datasheetGraph.jpg" alt="datasheetGraph.jpg" title="Datasheet characteristics for BAT47 diode">
		<p>
			After purchasing the diodes, their forward voltage was tested.
			The battery's voltage was imitated with a power supply at 1.55V and a trimmer potentiometer was used as the load.
		<p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/diodeTest.jpg" alt="diodeTest.jpg" title="Forward voltage test">
		</p>
			The BAT47 diode's forward voltage was probed at 0.2V for a forward current  of 213uA.
			Furthermore, it is operating within 6% error of the required 0.2V for a wide region of forward currents within the wanted range (1uA - 1mA).
			In fact its forward voltage drops to 0.188V at a forward current of 131uA and reaches 0.212V for a forward current of 696uA.

		<h3>
			Circuit
		</h3>
		<p>
			In order to place the diode in series with the battery in the adaptor, a piece of double sided copper clad board is used.
			The diode connects the two sides of the board and the battery sits on top of it.
			The direction of the current and the layout of the circuit becomes clearer in the next image.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/circuit.jpg" alt="circuit.jpg" title="Adapter circuit">
		<p>
			The copper clad board and thin steel sheet used were cut with a rotary tool.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/adaptorMaking.jpg" alt="adaptorMaking.jpg" title="Cutting the board">
		<h3>
			Casing
		</h3>
		<p>
			Casings for both the 386 and the smaller 392 cells were designed.
			The casing of the 392 cell also requires a piece of 1mm thick conductive material to fill in because the cell is too short in its own.

		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/392parts.jpg" alt="392parts.jpg" title="Parts fof the 392 cell adapter">
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/392section.jpg" alt="392section.jpg" title="392 adapter section view">
		<p>
			The 386 battery is much thicker so the diode was positioned inside the copper clad board and the board was trimmed a bit around that point.
			The area under the battery was filled in with some solder.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/386section.jpg" alt="386section.jpg" title="386 adapter section view">
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/386adapter.jpg" alt="386adapter.jpg" title="386 silver oxide battery adapter">
		<p>
			The above adaptors were proven to be slightly thicker than needed for some application so,
			a third, thinner adaptor was designed for the 386 cell.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/386Bsection.jpg" alt="386Bsection.jpg" title="386 thinner adapter section view">
		<p>
			To make the adapter thinner the diode was pushed to the side of the casing and is now visible from the outside.
			This created the extra space needed to keep the battery tangent to the copper clad board.
		</p>
		<p>
			The casings for the adaptors are printable without supports by orienting them thin side down.
			The STL files for both adaptors can be downloaded <a href="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/adapterCasing.rar" download>here</a>
		</p>
		<p class="secondary">
			Some battery compartments require electrical contact with the battery on its side.
			This adapter is plastic on its side and this could be a problem in such an application.
			Aluminum foil carefully wrapped on the appropriate side of the adaptor and around it could possibly solve this problem (not tested).

			F. de Gruijter's research
		</h3>
		<p>
			Mr. F. de Gruijter has written a comprehensive report on the mercury battery problem.
			Much of the knowledge for developing this adapter came from his research which
			is available <a href="/projects/normal/PX625_adapter/batt-adapt-US.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
