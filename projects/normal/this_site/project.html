		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<p>
			I was inspired by mitxela(<a href="https://mitxela.com/"  target="_blank">mitxela.com</a>) and
			bigclive(<a href="http://www.bigclive.com/" target="_blank">bigclive.com</a>) about creating my own website.
			As far as I know, they both created their sites themselves.
			They are a couple of brilliant individuals!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you feel inspired about creating your own site, you can!
			All you have to do is put in the effort - the knowledge is very well documented out there.
			<b>In this page I will guide you through the sources I used to learn how to build this site and all the programs-tools I used.</b>
			Keep in mind I had no knowledge on web development and it took me about 2 months to learn and develop this site.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Website anatomy
		</h3>
		<p>
			A website like this one is made from three languages: <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
			<b>HTML</b> is used to write any text and separate it into paragraphs or sections.
			<b>CSS</b> is then used on top of the HTML code to specify styling for the page such as fonts, colors or backgrounds.
			Last but not least, <b>JavaScript</b> helps make the page more interactive -
			you can make any element on the page change based on any user input.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can definitely write a beautiful, well working website without ever having to write a line of JavaScript.
			If you are planning to learn and use JavaScript, having previous knowledge with any other programming language will help immensely.
			HTML and CSS are not exactly programming languages and are easier to grasp.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Hello world
		</h3>
		<p>
			Writing your first "Hello world!" site is as easy as creating a .txt file,
			renaming the file to "(use any name here).html",
			opening the file with a text editor, writing "Hello world!" and then saving it.
			Here is what such a file looks like when opened with a web browser --&gt; <a href="/projects/normal/this_site/helloWorld.html" target="_blank">helloWorld.html</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now if instead of writing just "Hello world!" in this file, I wrote "&lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;"
			the resulting website would be this --&gt; <a href="/projects/normal/this_site/helloWorld2.html" target="_blank">helloWorld2.html</a>.
			I used HTML markup code to indicate that my text is an h1 headline so the font is now bigger in size.
		</p>
		<p>
			Changing the color can be done by using CSS.
			This time I write two lines of code in my HTML text file.
			On the first line I use CSS to indicate that all h1 headlines should be blue: "&lt;style&gt;h1{color: blue;}&lt;/style&gt;".
			The second line of code is the same line that was used before: "&lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;".
			Opening my file in a web browser now results in --&gt; <a href="/projects/normal/this_site/helloWorld3.html" target="_blank">helloWorld3.html</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Source for learning
		</h3>
		<p>
			I learnt these three languages over on a website called w3schools (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>).
			Their tutorials are packed with important knowledge to get you started and are well written.
			There are also exercises and an online platform where you can mess around with code.
			I suggest starting with their HTML tutorials and then heading over to CSS.
			You can create a complete site using these two languages.
			If you are planning on implementing an audio player or a sortable grid of content or any other interactive element,
			you will need to learn to use JavaScript as well.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Text editor
		</h3>
		<p>
			A text editor is necessary for typing code.
			Although an entire site could be written using Windows' notepad, it is not the best choice.
			Today there are smarter text editors designed to make coding faster and more efficient.
			Modern text editors will help by marking your code, autofill code, guess what you want to write, auto format your code and more.
			One of the most famous editors today is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Virtual Studio Code</a>, it is available for free and is easy to use.
			This text editor has a big community behind it and a number of extensions available to make programming easier.
			Here is a list of extensions I use with VS Code for writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript:
		</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>HTML CSS support - Code suggestions/autofill</li>
			<li>Auto Rename Tag - Helps rename html start and end tags simultaneously</li>
			<li>Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 - Colorizes bracket pairs (duh!)</li>
			<li>Prettier - Code formatter</li>
			<li>Live Server - Lets you open the page you are editing and have it change live, every time you change the code (very helpful)</li>
			<li>Indent rainbow - Helps visualize the code indents</li>
			<li>Code Spell Checker - Checks spelling for the English language</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			Versioning
		</h3>
		<p>
			If you are taking over a large programming project such as building a website,
			it is highly recommended that you use a versioning program.
			A versioning program helps keep track of all the changes you make in the code and why you make them.
			It helps you keep a very analytical history of your project's progress.
			It also gives the advantage of being able to rollback to previous versions
			which is invaluable if you ever regret changes that you made.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is the most used versioning program nowadays (Apr 2021).
			By default it is terminal based - it has no graphical user interface and is operated via a terminal.
			If that scares you, there are programs such as <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" target="_blank">GitKraken</a>
			designed to offer a graphical user interface for Git.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Inspecting
		</h3>
		<p>
			You can inspect any webpage's code and files by right clicking on it and selecting "inspect".
			In the inspect menu you can read the page's HTML,
			you can read the active CSS styling rules on each page element
			and you can read any JavaScript program that runs on the page.
			This is very useful in many ways:
		</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Inspect your own page to better understand how your code behaves</li>
			<li>Inspect your favorite web page to get inspired by how it is coded and have a good example in mind</li>
			<li>Use the JavaScript Debugger to tune and correct your JavaScript code</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Try right clicking on the first paragraph of this site and then press "inspect".
			This is what should appear:
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/this_site/inspect.png" alt="inspect.png" title="Inspect Element">
		<p>
			On the left side there is the site's HTML and the paragraph you selected is highlighted.
			Under the Styles tab all the CSS rules that affect the selected paragraph are visible (font, color etc.).
			On the Sources tab, all the files that make up the page are available and that includes the JavaScript files:
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/normal/this_site/inspectJS.png" alt="inspect.png" title="Inspecting the JavaScript">
		<p>
			A debugger is available after clicking onto a JavaScript file.
			You can set break points, watch all available variables and step through the code.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Hosting
		</h3>
		<p>
			After writing your website all that remains is making it available on the internet.
			You can host your website using your own computer and network or
			you can pay for a hosting service.
			The limitations of hosting yourself are your network speed and the
			fact that you need to keep your computer busy all the time.
			Other than that, hosting from your own PC is a good way to get some first impressions and it is free.
			Hosting alone is enough to make your site available on the internet.
			Anyone will be able to visit your site by entering the server's public IP address in a browser's URL bar.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Domain name
		</h3>
		<p>
			Associating a name to the server's IP address is advised because a name is easier to remember and share with people.
			After doing so, anyone who types your domain name in the URL bar, will be redirected to your server's IP.
			You can get a free domain name associated to your chosen IP by visiting <a href="https://www.noip.com/" target="_blank">noip.com</a>.
			Alternatively, you can pay for a more formal name with a .com or .org extension.
		</p>
		<h3>
			In conclusion
		</h3>
		<p>
			Learning how to develop a website is not hard!
			Just head over to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>
			and read their tutorials on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
			Use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Virtual Studio Code</a> as your text editor
			and consider using a versioning program such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>
			to keep track of your progress.
			"Right click --&gt; Inspect" is a great tool for understanding how your code translates to site elements.
