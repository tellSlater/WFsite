			Power bank
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is a small power bank made of two 18650 lithium batteries.
			<b>In this page files and instructions necessary for building it</b>.

			
			
		</p>

		<h3>
			Schematic
		</h3>
		<p>
			The design incorporates a small ready-to-use board and only requires a minium amount of soldering.
			The two 18650 batteries should be soldered in parallel and then to the board's B+ and B- poles.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Batteries in parallel
		</h3>
		<p>
			Before soldering batteries in parallel it must be made sure that they have over-current protection or
			that they are outputting the same voltage.
			This is important since when connected in parallel, the emptier battery is charged by the other one
			until the two output the same voltage.
			This charge current is not controlled and could exceed the battery's maximum current ratings if the batteries are not protected.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="batteryBalanceBAD.jpg">
		<p>
			Connecting the batteries through a current limiting resistor will cause them to balance while keeping the current low.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="batteryBalanceResistor.jpg">
		<p>
			Most 18650 batteries are protected by an embedded over-current, over-voltage protection board
			that should prevent such mistakes from damaging the battery.

		<h3>
			Circuit
		</h3>
		<img src="" alt="circuitInCasing.jpg">
		<p>
			The soldered components will be embedded in the casing as shown in the above image.
			Electrical tape should be used in between the top portion of the batteries and the board
			to prevent any short circuits.
			Also, some elastic material (e.g. packaging foam) should be used on the bottom of the batteries
			to ensure that they will not rattle in the casing.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Casing
		</h3>
		<p>
			The casing is designed to be 3d printed.
			It is composed of two parts - the bottom and the top halves.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="casing.jpg">
		<p>
			The two halves of the casing are to be fastened together with a decorative cord or rubber bands.
		</p>

		<p>
			The STL files for the casing can be downloaded <a href="" download>here</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Leash
		</h3>
		<p>
			There is a hole for attaching a leash on the casing.
			It can be helpful since the powerbank could be worn on the wrist while it charges the phone in hand.
			A leash can be made by cord or an old leash can be used (e.g. from an old handheld gadget, flashlight or console).
