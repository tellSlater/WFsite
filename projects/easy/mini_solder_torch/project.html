			Mini solder torch
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is a small soldering iron that fits in a pocket.
			<b>In this page there is information about how it was made and how well it works</b>.
		</p>
		<h3>
			How it is made
		</h3>
		<p>
			This mini soldering iron is nothing more than a soldering tip designed for torches attached to a small barbecue lighter.
		</p>

		<img src="/projects/easy/mini_solder_torch/solder_tip.jpg" alt="solder_tip.jpg" title="Soldering tip and heat sink">
		<p>
			The tip is originally made for larger torch units but this mini butane lighter has
			enough power to drive it for a quick fix.
			The flame of the lighter passes through the heat sink, transferring its heat to it.
			Plain wire was used to attach the tip to the mini torch.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/easy/mini_solder_torch/mini_torch_assembled.jpg" alt="mini_torch_assembled.jpg" title="Assembled soldering torch">
		<p>
			The wire is woven around the tip in such a way that allows it to be attached or detached easily.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Performance
		</h3>
		<p>
			There is no automated temperature regulation.
			The only means of regulating the temperature on the tip of the iron are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The valve on the lighter that makes the flame smaller or bigger
			</li>
			<li>
				Putting out the flame and re-lighting it
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			It is not easy to overheat the tip though - the wattage on the tip seems to be low.
			After all this tip is designed for larger torches.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Power test
		</h3>
		<p>
			The net heat transferred to the tip is measured by monitoring the tip's temperature.
			A K-type thermocouple is attached to the tip with some thermal grease.
			The thermal grease is rated for 300°C.
		</p>
		<img src="/projects/easy/mini_solder_torch/HY510thermalGrease.jpg" alt="HY510thermalGrease.jpg" title="HY510 thermal grease">
		<p>
			The torch is lit on a medium flame and the time interval for ascending 100°C is measured.
		</p>
		<div class="video">
			<video src="/projects/easy/mini_solder_torch/powerTest.mp4" loop title="Testing the soldering tip" ontimeupdate ="animProg(this.parentNode)"></video>
			<div class="preplay" onclick="startPlayer(this)"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			It takes 25.5 seconds for the temperature to ascend from 29°C to 129°C.
			The soldering tip is quite small made of steel and weights 1.8 grams.
			Its heat capacity can be estimated by multiplying by the material's heat capacity.
			Steel has a heat capacity of about 450 Joules per Kg per °C, so the tip has a heat capacity of 450 * 0.0018 = 0.81 Joules per °C.
			When its temperature ascends 100°C in 25.5 seconds, it absorbed 81 Joules.
			Therefore, the wattage of the heat transfer on the tip is 81 Joules / 25.5 seconds = 3.18 Watts.
		</p>
		<p>
			This power is very low for a soldering iron but
			it is still able to reach a proper soldering temperature and help make a few fixes.
