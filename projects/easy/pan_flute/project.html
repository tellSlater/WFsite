            <h2>Pan flute</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This is a classic pan flute made of Arundo Donax reed.
                <b>In this page there is information about making tuning and playing this instrument</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>How it sounds</h3>
            <p>The sound is mellow although not as full as some commercially bought pan flutes.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <video
                    src="/projects/easy/pan_flute/panFlutePlaying.mp4"
                    loop

                <div class="preplay" onclick="startPlayer(this)"></div>
            </div>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>
                Air is blown perpendicular to the reed tubes in order to make sound. The technique is similar to playing
                the flute or making sound out of a glass bottle.
            </p>
            <img

                title="Blowing technique"
            />
            <p class="secondary">
                To succeed in making sound one should try blowing air tangent to one's chin. The head must remain
                upright. The flute or bottle or pan flute should then be positioned vertically on the chin.
            </p>
            <h3>Arundo Donax reed</h3>
            <p>
                This species of reed is native to the greater middle East (countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Iran ...).
                The pieces used in this project were harvested near a river in Greece. There is more information about
                Arundo Donax on its
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundo_donax" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Tuning the flute pieces</h3>
            <p>
                The pieces of reed can be tuned by altering their length. The shorter a piece the higher in pitch is the
                note it produces.
            </p>

                title="Reed pieces length tuning"
            />
            <h3>Tying the flute pieces</h3>
            <p>
                After all the pieces of reed are tuned, they should be tied together on some short of chassis. There are
                different shorts of chassis used for pan flutes. The main idea is fixing the pieces together in order
                from longer to shorter (or from the most bass note to the most treble).
            </p>
            <p>
                This instrument was tied with twine onto a couple pieces of reed positioned vertically to the pieces of
                reed that produce the notes.
