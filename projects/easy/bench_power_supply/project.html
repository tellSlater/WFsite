			Bench PSU
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Summary
		</h3>
		<img src="" alt="DP20V2A.jpg">
		<p>
			A bench PSU is a great tool for anyone who want to start tinkering with electronics.
			Unfortunately, their price can easily reach north of 100€.
			This 40W PSU costs less than 20€ delivered!
			It is usually listed online as <b>DP20V2A</b>.
			It might not be as powerful as most bench PSUs but it can be a great tool for starters.
			<b>In this page there are basic specifications for the unit as well as a how to build a casing for it</b>.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Basic specifications
		</h3>
		<p>
			As stated by various sellers, the specifications of this PSU are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Maximum output voltage: 20V
			</li>
			<li>
				Voltage selection resolution: 0.01V
			</li>
			<li>
				Output voltage accuracy: +/- (0.5% + 1 digit)
			</li>
			<li>
				Maximum output current: 2A
			</li>
			<li>
				Current selection resolution: 0.01A
			</li>
			<li>
				Output current accuracy: +/- (0.5% + 2 digits)
			</li>
			<li>
				Maximum output wattage: 40W
			</li>
			<li>
				Input voltage: 4.5 - 23V DC
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			It should be noted that the PSU requires a DC input to operate.
			23V is its absolute maximum rating and should not be exceeded.
			The PSU works in step-down mode and can supply voltages up to 3V bellow its input voltage to its output.
			If 23V are applied to its input it will be able to output up to 20V at its output.
			If in stead a standard 12V wall adapter is used to supply the PSU, it will only be able to output up to 9V.
		</p>
		<p>
			When specifying accuracy, "+x digits" means least significant digits of the display.
			In the case of voltage accuracy +1 digit would be 0.01V.
			As for the current accuracy, +2 digits corresponds to a 0.1A error.
			The percentage errors should be added to these constant values to estimate the total error for these outputs.
		</p>
		<p>
			These specifications are obviously not great but acceptable when factoring in the price of this instrument.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Casing
		</h3>
		<p>
			The casing that was used for this unit was designed in Fusion360 and was 3D printed.
			Some extra components such as banana plugs and a switch were used for the casing.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="fusionCase.jpg">
		<p>
			The STL files for this casing can be downloaded <a href="" download>here</a>.
			Alternatively, there are countless other designs available for 3D printing on
			<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=DP20V2A&type=things&sort=relevant" target="_blank">thingiverse</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than 3D printing, a case could be made out of any small box that is available.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Supplying the PSU
		</h3>
		<p>
			As stated above, the PSU accepts a DC input of maximum 23V.
			The higher the input the more range its output will have in voltage since the PSU operates in step-down mode.
			ideally a 23V - 2A supply should be used.
			If such a supply is not available, any outlet adapter can be used.
			When using a random adapter to source the PSU it is important to note that:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The output of the PSU will be capped at 3V lower than the supply voltage
			</li>
			<li>
				The adapter will most probably be rated lower than 40W and should not be used beyond its limits
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A 12V/1A wall adapter could be used to supply the PSU but if the PSU tries to pull more than 1A,
			the adapter could be damaged.
			Great care must be taken in general when using components that were not designed to be used together.
