			Ceation
		</h3>
		<p>
			I decided to create this site in order to have a place where I can gather all my projects, document them properly and share them with you.
			I enjoy creating and sharing - I treasure the feeling that I get when I see others enjoy my work, learn from my work or being entertained by it.
			I may also have the opportunity to share some of the projects of a few close friends.
		</p>
		<p class="secondary">
			You may ask "why not make a profile on Instructables or any other such website?".
			The answer is that I wanted to try and take on the challenge of building a website on my own.
			In the process, I have come to realize that making a profile and using it on a platform is one thing but making your own website is quite another.
			I could compare the experience as living in a hotel room (a platform) or living in your own house (own website).
			No matter how many utilities and comforts a big hotel may have, it will never be as cosy as your own space.
			Thus, this site was born!
		</p>
		<h3>
			Content
		</h3>
		<p>
			The content on this site falls in two main categories in the home page: <b class="PS2P">PROJECTS</b> and <b class="PS2P">MUSIC</b>.
			On the <b class="PS2P">PROJECTS</b> page there is content mainly about crafting-themed projects that revolve around 3d designing, 3d printing, electronics, synthesizers, CNC and more.
			On the <b class="PS2P">MUSIC</b> page there is content about songs that I write, improvise, cover or interpret alone or with friends.
			There is also a link to a contact form on the main page - feel free to ask me anything you like or just send me a message!
		</p>
		<h3>
			Difficulties
		</h3>
		<p>
			I decided to categorize the projects according to their difficulty in three categories: <b class="PS2P">EASY</b>, <b class="PS2P">NORMAL</b> and <b class="PS2P">HARD</b>.
			Don't expect this to be an accurate estimation and, moreover, don't let the titled difficulty of a project disheart you.
			I am sure that anyone can tackle any project if he/she really wants to do it.
			Difficulties are only a broad line I drew to let you know of the amount of effort I had to put into each project and the possible amount of effort a project could demand from you as well.
		</p>
		<h3>
			My background
		</h3>
		<p>
			I studied classical and electric guitar in my younger years and have acquired the RGT grade 7 diploma for electric guitar.
			I graduated from the “Lycée Léonin de Patissia Athènes” high-school.
			Finally, I received a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Thessaly.
			Other than my “legitimately proven knowledge” that is stated in the previous three sentences, I have been developing other skills on my own as well.
			There are so many interesting subjects in this world that every month I catch myself trying to learn or create something new (learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and creating this site for instance).
