            <h3>Creation</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to create this site in order to have a place where I
                can gather all my projects, document them properly and share
                them. I treasure the feeling of seeing others learn from my work
                or being entertained by it.
            </p>
            <p class="secondary">
                You may ask "why not make a profile on Instructables or any
                other such website?". The answer is that I wanted to try and
                take on the challenge of building a website on my own. In the
                process, I have come to realize that making a profile and using
                it on a platform is one thing but making your own website is
                quite another. I could compare the experience as living in a
                hotel room (a platform) or living in your own house (own
                website). No matter how many utilities and comforts a big hotel
                may have, it will never be as cosy as your own space. Thus, this
                site was born!
            </p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>
                The content on this site falls in two main categories in the
                home page: <b class="PS2P">PROJECTS</b> and
                <b class="PS2P">MUSIC</b>. On the
                <b class="PS2P">PROJECTS</b> page there is content mainly about
                crafting-themed projects that revolve around 3d designing, 3d
                printing, CNC, electronics, synthesizers, programming and more.
                On the <b class="PS2P">MUSIC</b> page there is content about
                songs that I write, improvise, cover or interpret alone or with
                friends. There is also a link to a contact form on the main page
                - feel free to ask me anything or just send me a message!
            </p>
            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>
                The projects on this site are sorted according to their
                difficulty in three categories: <b class="PS2P">EASY</b>,
                <b class="PS2P">NORMAL</b> and <b class="PS2P">HARD</b>. This
                system is mostly used to measure the amount of effort I had to
                put into each project. The difficulties are not meant to
                disheart anyone from tackling a project.
            </p>
            <h3>My background</h3>
            <p>
                I studied classical and electric guitar and have acquired the
                RGT grade 7 diploma for electric guitar. I graduated from the
                “Lycée Léonin de Patissia Athènes” high-school. Finally, I
                received a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the
                University of Thessaly. Other than that, every month I catch
                myself trying to learn or create something new (learning HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript and creating this site for instance).
            </p>
