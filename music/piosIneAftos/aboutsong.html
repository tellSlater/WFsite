            <h3>Creation</h3>
            <p>
                Me and Ioanna were messing around with this chord progression while I started singing these lyrics over
                it. It was surprisingly quite fitting and we decided to record it for fun! The lyrics are from the song
                "Ποιός είναι αυτός" from the artist Pantelis Pantelidis - famous in Greece. You can listen to the
                original song on YouTube for reference:

                Firstly, I wrote the chord progression. Then, I had Ioanna do 3 or 4 iterations of practicing in order
                to write a lead part. I actually lied to her! I was recording her practicing the lead part and used that
                in the mix. I cut the best parts of the solo and mixed it in the song. Sometimes the feeling of being
                recorded can make it harder to perform so I pulled this old trick on her! We added some drums and pads
                but never finalized it.
