			Pray (cover)
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Creation
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is a song from highschool(2010).
			"Pray" from "Blessthefall".
			I remember I really felt that song back then.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was my first try in mixing a whole band.
			I used Wavelab to mix this song - didn't know any better.
			I wrote and imported the drums from Guitar Pro.
			Pretty lame sound, I know, but this mix was (more or less) my first child and I was proud of it!
		</p>	
		<h3>
			Content
		</h3>
		<p>
			I tried to be as close to the original song as possible.
			Two guitars, bass and drums.
			I was actually quite bad at screaming but I used guitar overdrive over my voice to help bring out some noise.
