			Turkish march (cover)
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Creation
		</h3>
		<p>
			It was summer 2019.
			Me and Agelos were staying in his house in Kymi.
			One afternoon Agelos got fixated on the idea that we should transcribe this song learn it, practice it all night and
			in the morning walk to the mountain and make a video of it - a crazy challenge.
			As I recall, it sounded crazy and exhausting at that time but in the end, I agreed!			
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the video we watched in order to transcribe the song - a YouTube classic.

		</iframe>
		<p>
			After finally learning how to play the song at about 3:00am we had 2 more hours of practice in our hands.
			We agreed to start walking to the mountain before the sun came up.
			The practice went ok and after preparing some coffee we were off for the mountainside!
			We ended up walking for an hour in order to find the spot that we used.

		<p>
			We started recording videos at about 7:00am and ended at 9:00am.
			We had no perfect takes. 
			Realistically speaking though, a perfect take would be too much to ask considering the circumstances.
			This was our best result that day:

		<p>
			Observe the jar of Turkish coffee bottom left in the video - it helped a lot.
			Although it is not perfect we had tons of fun making this video!
		</p>
		<h3>
			Content
		</h3>
		<p>
			I guess this one song is more about the adventure that we had creating it rather than its content.
			Content-wise it is an one guitar - four hands cover of Mozart - Rondo Alla Turca (Turkish March).
