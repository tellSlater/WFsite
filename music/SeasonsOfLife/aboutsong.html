		<h3>
			Creation
		</h3>
		<p>
			Back in high school playing guitar was our main hobby.
			Me and my friend Agelos would spend hours and hours
			trying to figure out our favorite bands' riffs or compose our own songs.
			Unfortunately many of the songs we wrote, we have now forgotten
			but at least we were lucky enough to record this one (around 2010)!

		<p>
			Whenever I record a duet I like panning the two instruments completely to the left and right
			so that the listener will be able to isolate each one by panning the audio.
			On this recording, my guitar is left and Agelos' to the right.
			The song had four parts so we named it seasons... Seasons of life - that's better!
			Some time after we recorded it, I made a silly video on YouTube and uploaded it there:
