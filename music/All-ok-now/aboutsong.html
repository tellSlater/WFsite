			Creation
		</h3>
		<p>
			I came up with this song while listening to the birds and the city sounds from my window around May 2019 in Athens.

		<p>
			Unfortunately I didn't have two microphones at that time so I could not record my guitar and the window sounds at the same time.
			I had to first record some environment sounds and then mix them together with the guitar which didn't help me render the result I was looking for.
			I also tried adding some throat-singing overtones I had been practicing for fun.
