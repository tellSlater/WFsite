            <p>
                I have always considered Pink Floyd to be a great band. "The wall" is probably my most listened album
                from them. At that time back then I was trying to learn to play the keyboard so I couldn't resist giving
                this song a try. I like everything about this song. Originally I had made a video of it:

                I was practicing this song on the keyboard for days already. It was a rainy Summer day and, by that
                time, I had become somewhat comfortable playing it, so I decided to record it. The rain was barely
                audible in the recording, so I decided to mix in a "rainy mood" sample. The sound is pretty bad cause I
                was using a logitech webcam mic back then.
