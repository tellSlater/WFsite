		<h3>
			Creation
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is a song I wrote while experimenting for the first time with a synth I wrote in C for an AVR microcontroller.
			I called it ZNEAR synth!
			The synth was finished somewhere around the end of 2020 and I more or less wanted to test its capabilities.
			The synth itself is available as a project in the site's projects page. 
			(Link <a href="/projects/hard/znear_synth/project.html" target="_blank">here</a>)

		<h3>
			Content
		</h3>
		<p>
			Every sound audible in this song is a result of additive synthesis using this synthesizer.
			In other words - all the sounds are "fake"!
			The ocean, the air that blows, the seagulls, the pads, the bells and the bass.
			The sea waves and air are made of a combination of noise waves whose volumes are modulated by ADSR envelopes.
			The seagulls are high pitched - swept down triangle waves with short attacks and longer releases.
		</p>
		<p>
			I should point out that the synth is incapable of outputting more than two waves at a time.
			Whenever more than two sounds are audible in this song it is because they were mixed together after pre-recorded as samples from the synthesizer.
			I wrote this song using Reaper.
